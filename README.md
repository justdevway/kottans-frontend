## Linux CLI, and HTTP

![CLI - help, HTTP - need know](task_linux_cli/cli.jpg)

CLI - relly help if you want to make some little change in your filesystem or file. Also can help make commands easier if you want to configure your work environment. :)

## Git Collaboration

![Repeat git commands](task_git_collaboration/git_collaboration_1.jpg)
![Describe how to work with remote repository](git_collaboration_2.jpg)

I think this two task help me learn git in details. I have increased my knowledge about git log and learned more about work with remote repository.
In future I will definitely use git log --stat --oneline :)
